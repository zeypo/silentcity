#Support
We've been making Tumblr themes since 2009. Truth to be told, we wouldn't still be afloat had we not acknowledged, early on, that each individual customer is important. Exceptional, human customer support matters to us a great deal.

Each one of our themes comes fully backed by our dedicated support team (all of us). We're good people, with real faces, and we like what we do. We've also created a help centre so you can get help at any hour. Send us an email or tweet at us during office hours (we're in PST!).

We're always happy to answer questions. Not sure what theme is best? Looking for a particular feature? Get in touch.
